    <p><strong>WARNING. ONLY LOAD THIS PAGE ON WIFI. It will download a ton of fonts</strong></p>
    <p>because of github's file size limit, this page has a list of half of the google fonts. if you'd like to see a table with the rest of the google fonts, download <a href="https://github.com/amonks/font-robot">the source code</a>, and follow the instructions</p>
    <p>it will take a while to load. in a couple seconds you'll see the list, then a couple seconds after that you'll start seeing the fonts themselves.</p>
    <p>you can click table headings to sort by each column</p>
    <p>if you click a font, you'll see the other fonts sorted by similarity to that clicked font. most similar at the top</p>
